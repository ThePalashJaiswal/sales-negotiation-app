# Sales & Negotiation Trainer 🎧

A self-learning web app to practice:

- Cold calling mindset & rules  
- Handling ghosting & objections  
- Negotiation using a Harvard-style framework  
- Real-world role-play scenarios  

Built with **Streamlit**, deployed via **Streamlit Community Cloud**.

## How it works

- **Learn**: Go through modules and lessons (mindset, cold calling, negotiation).
- **Quiz**: Short MCQs after each lesson to reinforce learning.
- **Role-Play**: Scenario-based practice with example good/bad responses.
- **Progress**: See how many lessons & scenarios you’ve completed.

## Run online

The app is designed to run entirely online using Streamlit Cloud, no local Python needed.
